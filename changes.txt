Changes Zaiband 3.0.9
- The Black Market has what you need, when you need it (as long as it is affordable).  At least, for:
** ?Word of Recall
** !Restore [stat]
** !Restore Experience
  This availability boost should require the affected items to not be available in any other store (including the home), 
  and for @ to have nothing relevant.
- The Black Market will no longer taunt you with unaffordable Rings of Speed at CL 1.  In fact, 
  no store should taunt you with truly unaffordable items (as of the time of store maintenance). The only exception will be to 
  prevent infinite looping of the store maintenance backend.  [In particular, the Magic Shop may taunt you with unaffordable items before 
  your first trip.]
- Stores should have fewer boring armors and weapons now, assuming that they can get interesting ones in.  Note that other than missiles,
  multiple instances of the exact same kind of armor or weapon are boring.  You will only see one of each kind in stock, regardless of 
  how many are actually in stock.
- I couldn't think of a good reason in-character reason why summon traps should look identical to teleport traps when visible.  
  They no longer do (but still have the same descriptive text).
- !Experience adjusted to restore experience first, to match the Gain [stat] potions
- cost rebalancing: first pass at resolving inadequate value of enchantment pluses.
- monster pathfinding now has limited awareness of cover and concealment
- non-stupid monsters that both have los on you, and los on a sleeping monster, will try to wake the sleeping monster automatically 
  (doesn't cost a turn)
- Energy recovery is now a public stat (you can see the monster's energy recovery when you target them...and vice versa).  When there is a ratio,
  yours is on the left.
- Points-based generation has been revamped.  Any stat combination from autorolling or classical generation is now possible, and no others.
  Gold from points-based generation is exactly equivalent to that from either autorolling or classical generation.  Starting point is 
  all optimistic median stats; you can reduce stats below their starting values if necessary.
- option defaults changed:
** flow_by_sound/flow_by_small/view_yellow_lite/view_bright_lite/view_granite_lite/view_special_lite/smart_monsters/smart_packs on
** run_ignore_stairs, run_ignore_doors, ring_bell off
** now birth: auto_scum, flow_by_sound, flow_by_smell, smart_monsters, smart_packs, smart_learn, smart_cheat, dungeon_align, dungeon_stair.
   Have these the way you want them before importing.
- JamesDoyle/Oook forums: a number of spelling tweaks to the artifact descriptions.
- from V SVN:
** all monsters that have great drops have good drops.
** extra color names
** character dump logic fix
** experience for monster kill, and native depth, obvious
** arrows, missiles, and boulders can miss now.  Using Zaiband's ranged attack penalties.
** selling in stores forced to start on character inventory
** Starting torches are implicitly store-bought (but 3500 turns)

Technical Changes Zaiband 3.0.9
- Windows port: require FF_MODERN (const-width font) as default rather than FF_DONTCARE
- Windows port: efficient font cache
- main-xaw.c is in the freezer now.
- k_idx disconnected from savefile relevance (and gone from object.txt).
- [Eddie Grove] ACTIVATE flag no longer exists.

Changes Zaiband 3.0.8 alpha
- monster recovery from stunning, confusion, and fear has been made 
  more consistent with player recovery.
- Line of sight/fire should be fully working now.  I adapted Tyrecius' 
  Permissive Field of View to V projection (relies on rational tangents as
  proxy for angles)
- a very simplistic damage estimator is in place.
- As a matter of consistent English, jellies no longer look alive when you look at them.  (Other descriptions already assumed they weren't.)
- from V: don't burn fuel during day in town
- from V: sound level normalization
- from V: disturb_minor option removed, forced always-on
- from V SVN: spellcasters always get at least one mana
- inspired by V SVN: launchers are also checked for multipliers.  Unlike V, launcher multipliers are cumulative with those from ammunition.
** Bard gets KILL_DRAGON for mythos reasons
- from V SVN: bigscreen support for self-knowledge display
- from V SVN: player melee criticals also multiply the damage bonus from the weapon
- inspired by Un, SSCrawl: player birth catches basic equipment holes.
** Any weapons or armor that can be equipped are equipped automatically 
   before starting play.
** Armor equipment slots are checked; if they aren't configured, a decidedly
   cheap option is automatically granted.  If you don't start with gloves, 
   it's because they hurt your spellcasting.
- The sidebar needed some documentation; it's in the dungeon section 
  of the help files.
- smart_cheat documentation slightly updated.
- Display changes:
** Display converged to V backend (finally).
** Energy recovery per time tick is now its own line.
** Monster health display also includes maximum hit points.
- Monster recall changes:
** Breath weapons are now obvious.
** Known melee attacks that can kill the player in one blow are now
   frightening, if one cares to check the monster recall.  At the moment,
   this has no in-game effect.
** Melee attacks that automatically get supercriticals are obvious.
   They are also frightening (with no in-game effect)
- monster attacks targeting inventory now automatically ignore 
  empty inventory slots.
- monster flowing adjusted: non-door openers will now not try to open doors 
  when a more feasible path exists and is fully visualizable by the monster.
- Pack AI adjusted: slot-filling behavior now occurs only when practical
- a monster failing to break a glyph of warding uses up its turn now.
- Noise changes:
** Bashing open doors is noisy enough to wake up monsters.  Even failing 
   to break open the door is noisier than simply walking.
** Monsters that cry out in pain (in various ways) are making noise.
** Objects destroyed on the floor are noisy.
   For now, player inventory destruction isn't noisy.
- Energy changes:
** Diagonal energy move cost is 150.  Non-move commands do not use more energy
   (in particular, attacking).  This was implemented by changing 
   the energy threshold to 150.
** A monster that wakes up has its energy set to zero.
** Player incapacitation locks down energy to zero.  (This may be 
   from paralysis, or being knocked out.)
*** An incapacitated player makes no noise.
- ideas from Eddie Grove, Timo Pietilla
** average pseudo-id remapped to automatic free identify.
** Weak psuedo-id characters get automatic free identify 
   on average wielded items.
** merely viewing an object in the store makes you aware of it.  Entering 
   the store is not enough, you must actually have it in view.
- bugfix: window options now take
- bugfix: dice sides larger than 255 no longer subject to modulo 256 truncation (affects some dragon scale mails, etc.)

Technical changes Zaiband 3.0.8 alpha
- design by contract imposed for player_type::inven_cnt, player_type::inventory
- obfuscatory typedef cptr finally gone
- starting time tick at beginning of game is now 1 (minimal).
- licensing update: reviewed V SVN against Zaiband to determine where 
  disjunctive Koeneke/GPL license was applicable
** ui-menu.h prevented disjunctive Koeneke/GPL license from transferring
** z-file.h/c was automatically disqualified. (Zaiband uses the ISO C 
   z-file.h/c rather than V's)
** As of the time of the licensing update, many *.h files either had 
   no license notice or were under pure Koeneke, in spite of declared 
   intentions for V3.1.0.  *.h files with corresponding *.c files generally 
   were elevated to whatever license the *.c file had.  Remaining files with 
   limited inclusion were elevated based on whether all inclusions were 
   disjunctive-licensed.  (Note that copyright attribution is probably off 
   on some of these.)

Changes Zaiband 3.07
- trap generation is somewhat more intelligent.
- autoinscriptions that block actions only work once, no matter how many
  of them there are.  !* is still cumulative with action-specific blocks.
- projection paths (arrows, bolt spells, etc.) have been adjusted.
  Knight-move ambush still works, but the hockey puck corridor won't.
  The easier trick shots are automatically handled.  There probably are
  a few bugs where invisible squares can be hit by careful choice of position
  targeting, but I haven't checked for them carefully.
- the reasonable bolt and summons checks in monster AI have been disconnected
  from the smart_monsters option.  [They, at least, are working.]
- discounts have been eliminated.
- player noise is now generated when the player does something.  A single
  central check is made, and if the player made noise it is applied
  to all monsters that should be affected.  Aggravation, being more mystical,
  happens when the monster is processed.
- options eliminated
** forced true: fresh_before, allow_quantity, expand_list
** forced false: fresh_after, stack_force_costs

Technical changes Zaiband
- Makefile system resynced
-- Makefile.mpw moved to freezer
-- new Makefile.ros
-- retaining Makefile.cyg and Makefile.con in parallel with new Makefile.win
   for now
- fonts resynced
- view_g and view_n were eliminated as part of the line of sight changes.
  They may come back in player_type if needed.
- generalized Djikstra-based flow_from function in new file flow.c .
  Used to quash some bugs with fleeing monsters and doors.

Changes Zaiband 3.0.6s1:
- arrow key support merged from Angband 3.07s3; disabled for VMS, until 
  correct arrow key values are determined somehow.
- partial merge of advanced pluralizer support from Angband 3.07s3
- monster immunities are more informatively described now.
- merge of "Inscribing an item with '!t' will now confirm if you try to take it
  off."
- merge of advanced recharge notice [If a stack of rods is recharging, you'll
  get a message when the first rod is recharged and another message when they
  are all recharged. There is no message when the second, third, etc., rod
  is recharged. (Hugo Kornelis)]
- moronicity check: truly pointless actions are now rejected by the character,
  based on INT and WIS.

Technical changes Zaiband 3.0.6s1:
- main.c changes ported from Angband 3.07s3 : Add console mode patch for
  Windows (Frank Palazzolo)
- main-ami.c copied from Angband 3.07s3
- numerous other partial merges
- mirrored script.h, squelch.c . so we can try to recycle makefiles from V
- POLICY: Zaiband will keep VM macro for now
- Makefile.win deleted as unneeded, it was for Borland C 4.52; 
  Borland has made 5.5 command-line freeware.
- the freezer subdirectory is for catastrophically unmaintained code.
  * main-ami.c, Makefile.ami : Amiga
  * main-emx.c, Makefile.emx : OS2
  * Makefile.bcc : Borland 5.5 command-line
  * Makefile.lcc : lcc32 compiler
  * Makefile.ibm : seems to be handled by Makefile.dos
  * Makefile.ros : RISCOS
  * if you actually *need* either genuine termio or genuine BSD tchars, the 
    relevant versions of main-gcu.c and main-cap.c are here.
- coord struct definition moved from dungeon.c to types.h; I'm testing 
  whether the C function calls can be switched around to use coord rather 
  than y,x pairs cleanly.  Not sure whether this is worth doing in C, as C 
  doesn't have the necessary operator overloading for clean code.
- [CONSIDER: imported debugging macros from Zaimoni.STL .]

Changes Zaiband 3.0.6:
- LUA support is gone.  Partial conversion to C++.
- hit dice are now sorted in decreasing order.
- ranged penalties have been changed to be more geometric.  Also,
  ranged accuracy suffers when monsters are in melee range.
- new gazes: presbyopic, hyperopic, ranged, and clairvoyant.
	myopic: range 1, as before.
    presbyopic: range 2-4
    hyperopic: range 4+
    ranged: LoS range
    clairvoyant: in range, ignore physical obstacles
	The Zaiband equivalent to a V Floating eye, is a Myopic floating eye.
    A Zaiband floating eye has a ranged gaze.
- Immobile, stupid monsters now take out appropriate items, that end up
  under them.
    Eats food?  It now spoils food under it.  [Rot jellies.]
    Eats light?  It now unfuels light sources under it.  [Silver jellies.]
    Acid attack?  Items vulnerable to acid, are destroyed under it.
     Similarly for electricity, fire, and cold.
- (Mobile) monsters that can attack to eat food, eat food from the floor.
  [E.g., green glutton ghosts.]

I just added the flag, and it worked immediately.  I.e. even though the Glaive
was created without it, it now activates.  I don't know if that is a good
thing or a bad thing.  IMO artifacts should not change in mid-game when
artifact.txt is modified, but I can sort of see the argument for it.

I changed the parser to give a warning, but maybe that is not enough.
I think I will change the parser so that anything with an activation sets
the TR3_ACTIVATE flag, making the F:ACTIVATE in artifact.txt not required.
IMO that kind of redundancy, a required flag fully implied by another line,
should be removed.

586: option rename

* this one's messy, and I'm not sure I agree with AS's file reorganization
** done:

/** modes for object_desc() */
enum object_desc_mode	{	ODESC_BASE = 0,

						};

680: stop making rings of stupidity, weakness, and woe; allow any/all rings to be cursed if game wants to make a bad item

726: kill -s option in main.c (show scores)
727: CCW rarity adjustment (study new V rarity config)

733: resist poison potion
742: store/AI fixes
750: swap priority of can_pickup and blind checks when picking up items

883: nerf missile weapon range (not sure about this one)
889: gold drop revamp
891: external config for store items
892: init error constant adjust
893: more specific errors
895: rand_int |-> randint0, randint |-> randint1, rand_die |-> randint1
896/897: adjust artifact.txt to use textual svals/tvals
898: temporary confusion resist
899: terror timed effect; stoneskin timed effect; Clear Mind effect; Deep Descent effect; Line of Sight confusion effect;

907: mass object reorganization
916: mithril ammo allowed to be SLAY_EVIL, VENOM

Ekolis/V Trac: should invisible traps have their attr/char pair hard-coded?
Idea: mushroom death drop is mushrooms
Idea: make DROP_?? and DROP_?D? "lexical flags"
Idea: configurable thresholds for R*
Idea: ironman option: V SVN detection range
Idea: player net worth used during store restocking
* cost suppression: done
* stop dominated items: needs rethink of store stocking.  In progress.
* intrastore sales: doable
* dynamic purse: savefile format change
** idea is that storekeeper's purse is a function of his current wealth; he's not really willing to spend more than 1% per purchase
** may want "psuedocustomers" to apply CHA/race effects with
** affects: intrastore sales
* warehousing: savefile format change
** store record has 10 bytes of deadspace : can swing dynamic purse on 4 bytes
Idea: automatic description of food value
* note: only food that has an interesting tradeoff against Rations is Beef Jerky, currently.  Would need a more complex hunger/thirst system to justify the others.
